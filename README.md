Primary_Game
============

code repository for the upcoming android game Primary.
Primary is built entirely in Unity3D using C#

This is all code for my android game primary.
All parts that I can release will be posted here, some parts are purchased assets and not open source.
The music I used in the game is all released under the creative commons non-commercial share alike.
So the code I write will also be cc nc sa.

Right now I am the only person working on this project.
I have one collaberating artist, but their work is not yet in the game.

This is my first game so constructive critisism is always welcome :)
